## Description:
Find the stimulus intensity with minimum expected entropy for each trial, to determine the psychometric function.
Psi adaptive staircase procedure for use in psychophysics, as described in Kontsevich & Tyler (1999)
and psi-marginal staircase as described in Prins(2013). Implementation based on the Palamedes toolbox (version 1.8.1) for Matlab.

## How to use:
Create a psi object instance with all relevant arguments. Selecting a correct search space for the threshold,
slope, guessing rate and lapse rate is important for the psi procedure to function well. If an estimate for
one of the parameters ends up at its (upper or lower) limit, the result is not reliable, and the procedure
should be repeated with a larger search range for that parameter.

The stimulus intensity to be used in the current trial can be found in the field xCurrent.

After each trial, update the psi staircase with the subject response, by calling the addData method.
