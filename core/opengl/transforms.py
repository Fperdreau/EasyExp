# transforms, create matrices like in the well known GL functions, and more.
# The last 4 elements of the 16 elements matrices are the translation.
# Note that these matrices are for pre-multiplication. (row vector, first transformation 
# first, left to right, Latin order, whatever you name it) Transpose the matrices for 
# post-multiplication.
# Typically one uses y = x M V P, where x is in model coordinates and y is in device coordinates
# - M is the model matrix which transforms from Object Coordinates to World Coordinates, 
# it is different for each object.
# - V is the view matrix which tranforms to Eye Coordinates, where the camera is in the 
#     origin and looks in -z direction. In fixed pipeline applications M * V is called
#     the modelview matrix.
# - P is the projection matrix which transforms to Device Coordinates (or clip coordinates). 
# After this a normalization is performed. (division by w, the fourth coordinate). We now speak
# of Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC). NDC is clipped to -1 -- 1 in each dimension. Last 
# step is transformation to screen coordinates.
